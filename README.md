# ADO_scripts

This repository hosts all the Python scripts related to the work titled "Fast nonparametric Bayesian framework for on-the-fly adaptive design optimization using discrete priors."

Inside, you will find four main folders:

- Algorithm: Contains the primary scripts used to build the model and all the necessary functions. This folder also provides a general example demonstrating how to conduct an MSE analysis for numerical simulations, as well as a step-by-step tutorial for applying the algorithm to your own experiment.

- Our Online Experiment: The data analysis script contains all the statistical analyses and allows for the reconstruction of the figures presented in the article. Additionally, the database is accessible. However, within the Python script, there is a specific cell designed to filter the appropriate population used in the analysis, as the experiment was conducted online, resulting in numerous incomplete sessions that need to be excluded.

- Bahador Experiment and Karvat Experiment: Both contain the analyses conducted and their corresponding datasets. You can find references to these works in our paper.
