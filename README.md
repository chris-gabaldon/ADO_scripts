# ADO_scripts

This repository hosts all the Python scripts related to the work titled "Fast nonparametric Bayesian framework for on-the-fly adaptive design optimization using discrete priors."

Inside, you will find four main folders:

- Algorithm: Contains the primary scripts used to build the model and all the necessary functions. This folder also provides a general example demonstrating how to conduct an MSE analysis for numerical simulations, as well as a step-by-step tutorial for applying the algorithm to your own experiment.

- Our Experiment: Includes the database and analysis employed to set up our online experiment, as well as the Django script used to run it.

- Bahador Experiment and Karvat Experiment: Both contain the analyses conducted and their corresponding datasets. You can find references to these works in our paper.
